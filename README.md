🔧 Project Overview:
A Python program that simulates a basic command-line interface (CLI).

Supports common terminal commands like:

ls/dir : List directory contents

mkdir/md : Create directories

cat : Display file contents

help → Show supported commands

exit : Exit the CLI

🎯Purpose:
With this CLI, Python helps users learn how to execute commands in the terminal at a system level. The engine is developed to run properly across Windows, Linux and macOS. The command parser gives instructions when something goes wrong which improves user assistance.

🛠️Features:
The Program features important programming practices: grouping related parts into functions, accounting for problems through error handling and allowing input from the user through a repeated timing out loop for instructions. They are a thoughtful and simple way to understand how shells work.

All things considered, this application gives you an impression of Python’s ability to direct the system shell and interact with users. It serves two purposes: testing handling of commands, validating data input and making the code work on multiple platforms.
